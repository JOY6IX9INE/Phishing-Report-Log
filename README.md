# 🛡️ Phishing Report Log

Welcome! This is an open record of phishing domains I’ve identified and reported as part of independent threat intelligence efforts.

> 📁 All phishing site data is stored in [`reports.csv`](./reports.csv)

## 🎯 Purpose

This project aims to:
- 🕵️ Identify active phishing domains impersonating real brands.
- 🧾 Document findings in a transparent, structured format.
- 📤 Report threats to hosting providers, target companies, and global blocklists.

## 📂 How It Works

1. **Detect** suspicious domains manually or through feeds.
2. **Investigate** using WHOIS, DNS, and site behavior.
3. **Report** to:
   - Hosting/infra providers (e.g., Cloudflare, Namecheap)
   - Affected organizations (e.g., Riot Games, PayPal)
   - Security feeds (Google Safe Browsing, APWG)
4. **Log** in [`reports.csv`](./reports.csv)
