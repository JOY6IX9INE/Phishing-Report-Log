# 🛡️ Threat Report Log

Welcome! This is an open record of phishing **and scam** domains I’ve identified and reported as part of independent threat intelligence efforts.

> 📁 All site data is stored in [`reports.csv`](./reports.csv)

## 🎯 Purpose

This project aims to:
- 🕵️ Identify malicious domains, including:
  - 🎣 Phishing (login theft, impersonation)
  - 💰 Scams (fake giveaways, crypto rug pulls, support scams)
- 🧾 Document findings in a transparent, structured format.
- 📤 Report threats to hosting providers, target companies, and global blocklists.

## 📂 How It Works

1. **Detect** suspicious domains manually or through feeds.
2. **Investigate** using WHOIS, DNS, site content, and network behavior.
3. **Report** to:
   - 🧰 Hosting/infra providers (e.g., Cloudflare, Namecheap)
   - 🏢 Target organizations (e.g., Riot Games, PayPal)
   - 🛡️ Global blocklists (Google Safe Browsing, APWG)
4. **Log** everything in [`reports.csv`](./reports.csv)
